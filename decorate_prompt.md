Decorate the text in triple quotes below with backlinks. Keep the original text, but surround each person name, company name, and other nouns with double square brackets. So if the person has a name of Jerry, convert it to [[Jerry]]. Add backlinks to all people, places, things and projects. If it starts with a capital letter, backlink it. Do not include actions or verbs. Do not wrap responses in triple quotes. Do not translate the text. Preserve the original markdown formatting, including wikilinks and backlinks.
